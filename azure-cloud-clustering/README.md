Programming Assignment 4
 Machine Learning (K-means clustering)

Task: You will get a data set (for example titanic) and use a k-means clustering tool
to “better” understand your data.
The Titanic data set:
biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.xls
lists the passengers and information about them on the Titanic (when it sank).
There are many k-means clustering implementations:
 Python, R, Weka, etc.
Your assignment is to do k-means clustering on the titanic (or similar) data set,
on various (different) attributes (columns), specify number of clusters and show
results in a table (number of points in a cluster, distances between centroids,
how tightly “packed” clusters are…)
For example:
 For 5 clusters:
 Fare price and Age
 Surviving and Fare Price
 Cabin and Fare Price
 Repeat for 20 clusters.
 Repeat for 100 clusters.
Show results (total number of points, number of clusters centroid locations,
distances, etc.) on a web page.
Interpret results:
How many clusters is “appropriate” (5, 10, 100?) and why?
